1. Open this ([greenchoice.apk](https://github.com/kavyaprasad00/gdsc_greenchoice/releases/tag/1.2.4)).
2. Download the Source Code (zip) version onto your device and unzip it.
3. Download and send the greenchoice.apk file onto your Android device.
4. Enable the installation of APK Files on your device (if this is not enabled already): Settings > Apps > Menu > Special access > Install unknown apps.
5. Open greenchoice.apk, tap download and allow the application to install. (You may get an unsafe installation notification on your device. Press download anyways to allow the app to download)
6. Enjoy the application!
